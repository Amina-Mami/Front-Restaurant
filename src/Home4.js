      <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
      <h3>Chicago</h3>
      <p>After dinner service, we would make a fire. Early in the morning, our baker Austin Hall would come in, rake out the coals and bake bread for the day. This bread became a part of Roman’s at every service and staff meal. Soon the chefs at Marlow & Sons and Diner wanted to bring the same quality and integrity to the bread they served.

We expanded bread production to our own space in Greenpoint, and now supply the bread served at all of our restaurants and others around the city. You can also purchase loaves to take home at Marlow & Daughters, Stranger Wines, Roman’s, and Achilles Heel, as well as at nine NYC Greenmarkets.</p>
